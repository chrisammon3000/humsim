# HumSim - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
A browser-based application featuring a realistic hummingbird that follows the user's mouse cursor with authentic flight physics and wing animation.

## Core Requirements

### Visual Design
- **Background**: Blank white screen
- **Hummingbird**: Geometric minimalism with polygonal architecture
  - **Body**: Hexagonal or diamond-shaped polygon (20×30px) that tilts based on movement direction
  - **Wings**: Triangular polygons (15×25px) with sharp vertices - each wing moves independently
  - **Head**: Small triangular polygon that can rotate independently for beak direction
  - **Tail**: Small triangular polygon that can adjust independently during flight
  - All polygonal shapes with sharp vertices - no curves or rounded edges
  - Each part moves independently during flight for dynamic articulation
  - Flat design with no gradients, shadows, or decorative elements
  - Modern tech aesthetic (Apple/Tesla style) - precise, mathematical polygons
  - No pre-made sprites - all shapes drawn programmatically using mathematical precision

### Movement Physics
- **Hover-Dart-Hover Behavior**: Authentic hummingbird flight pattern
  - Start from hovering position
  - Ease in to movement (smooth acceleration)
  - Achieve maximum speed quickly
  - Maintain speed during travel
  - Ease out to precise stop at destination
- **Mouse Following**: Bird moves toward current mouse cursor position
- **No Other Flight Patterns**: Focus solely on point-to-point movement

### Wing Animation System
- **Multi-Property Animation**:
  - Wing rotation (primary movement) - each wing independently
  - Wing scaling (simulate folding/extending) - triangular shape deformation
  - Wing angle adjustment based on travel direction - independent per wing
  - Head rotation for beak direction pointing
  - Tail adjustment for flight dynamics
- **Speed Variation**:
  - Slower wing beat during hover
  - Faster wing beat during flight
- **Independent Part Movement**:
  - Each polygonal part (body, left wing, right wing, head, tail) moves independently
  - Dynamic articulation creates realistic flight behavior
- **Motion Blur Effect**:
  - Sophisticated canvas trail technique
  - Semi-transparent overlay instead of full canvas clear
  - Creates subtle, refined wing blur streaks that suggest motion without overwhelming the geometric forms

### Technical Implementation

#### Technology Stack
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API (2D)
- **Animation**: Anime.js for smooth movement easing
- **Physics**: Custom JavaScript for hummingbird-specific behavior
- **Layout**: Fullscreen responsive canvas

#### Canvas Setup
- **Size**: Full browser window (100vw × 100vh)
- **Responsive**: Automatically resize with window changes
- **Mouse Tracking**: Real-time cursor position detection
- **Coordinate System**: Canvas coordinates mapped to screen coordinates

#### Performance Requirements
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS target
- **Smooth Animation**: No stuttering or lag in movement
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers with Canvas support

## User Experience

### Interaction Model
- **Primary Interaction**: Mouse movement controls hummingbird destination
- **Immediate Response**: Hummingbird begins movement sequence on mouse position change
- **Continuous Tracking**: Bird follows mouse in real-time with realistic delays

### Visual Feedback
- **Motion Blur**: Wings show blur effect during rapid movement
- **Body Orientation**: Bird tilts and orients toward movement direction
- **Wing Speed**: Visual indication of hover vs flight states through wing beat frequency

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure
- Fullscreen canvas setup
- Mouse position tracking
- Basic hummingbird shape rendering

### Phase 2: Movement Physics
- Hover-dart-hover movement implementation
- Anime.js integration for smooth easing
- Mouse-following behavior

### Phase 3: Wing Animation
- Multi-property wing animation system
- Speed variation based on movement state
- Body orientation adjustments

### Phase 4: Motion Blur & Polish
- Canvas trail motion blur implementation
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing

## Success Criteria
- Hummingbird movement feels authentic and natural
- Wing motion blur creates convincing realism
- Smooth 60 FPS performance across target browsers
- Responsive design works on various screen sizes
- Intuitive mouse-following behavior

## Technical Constraints
- Browser-only implementation (no server required)
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- No external dependencies except Anime.js
- Works offline after initial load
